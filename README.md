# pidgin-openfetion

a clone of the pidgin plugin of openfetion

project home: https://code.google.com/p/ofetion/

Thanks to happyaron and other guys who contributed to this project.

## Update

The old version of pidgin-openfetion (including openfetion, cli-openfetion, etc.) doesn't work any more because the official fetion server update the protocol and openfetion will only get a "your fetion client is out of date" when you try to login. And the pidgin (or the other version of openfetion) will be CRASHED!

This repo update the login protocol for a little by following SmartFetion protocol to fix the problems.

## Build & Install

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a new dir `pidgin-openfetion/build`
3. cmake .. && make
4. move `libopenfetion.so` to `~/.purple/plugins`
5. try to login, prey, it will work

## Disclaimer

There is no guarantee for the modification will actually work fine. But for me, it does.

## Something more

It was something once saving my life, literally.
